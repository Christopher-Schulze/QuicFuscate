## üöÄ Next-Generation Stealth VPN Technology

QuicFuscate represents the pinnacle of privacy-focused networking, combining cutting-edge encryption, adaptive error correction, and advanced traffic obfuscation to create an impenetrable communication channel. Built on the QUIC protocol with HTTP/3 support, it delivers both speed and security without compromise.

> **Note:** This project is currently in active development, being refactored from C++ to Rust for enhanced performance and security.

## ‚ú® Core Features

### üõ°Ô∏è Advanced Stealth Technology
- **uTLS Fingerprinting Protection**: Mimics browser TLS fingerprints to evade deep packet inspection
- **Domain Fronting**: Masks traffic by routing through trusted CDN providers
- **HTTP/3 Masquerading**: Disguises traffic as standard HTTP/3 web traffic
- **Traffic Obfuscation**: XOR-based packet transformation to defeat pattern recognition
- **Spin Bit Randomization**: Prevents network analysis through QUIC protocol fingerprinting

### üîí Military-Grade Encryption
- **AEGIS-128L/X**: Authenticated encryption with hardware acceleration
- **MORUS-1280-128**: Lightweight cipher for resource-constrained environments
- **Perfect Forward Secrecy**: Ephemeral key exchange for maximum security
- **Post-Quantum Ready**: Designed to resist quantum computing attacks

### ‚ö° Performance Optimizations
- **SIMD Acceleration**: ARM NEON and x86 AVX2/AVX-512 optimizations
- **Zero-Copy Architecture**: Minimizes memory allocations for maximum throughput
- **Adaptive FEC**: TETRYS-based Forward Error Correction with dynamic redundancy
- **Connection Multiplexing**: Multiple streams over a single connection
- **0-RTT Handshake**: Reduced latency for subsequent connections

### üîÑ Adaptive Error Correction
- **TETRYS FEC Implementation**: Advanced coding scheme for lossy networks
- **Dynamic Redundancy**: Automatically adjusts to network conditions
- **Packet Recovery**: Up to 30% packet loss tolerance
- **Bandwidth-Efficient**: Minimal overhead compared to traditional FEC

## üèóÔ∏è Project Status

This project is currently being refactored from C++ to Rust to leverage modern language features and safety guarantees. The core functionality is being preserved while improving performance and security.

### Current Implementation (C++)
- QUIC protocol stack
- Basic VPN functionality
- Core encryption modules
- Initial stealth features

### In Progress (Rust)
- Complete protocol rewrite
- Enhanced security features
- Performance optimizations
- Expanded platform support
