## üöÄ Next-Generation Stealth VPN Technology

QuicFuscate represents the pinnacle of privacy-focused networking, combining cutting-edge encryption, adaptive error correction, and advanced traffic obfuscation to create an impenetrable communication channel. Built on the QUIC protocol with HTTP/3 support, it delivers both speed and security without compromise.

> **Note:** This project is currently in active development, being refactored from C++ to Rust for enhanced performance and security.

## ‚ú® Core Features

### üõ°Ô∏è Advanced Stealth Technology
- **uTLS Fingerprinting Protection**: Mimics browser TLS fingerprints to evade deep packet inspection
- **Fake TLS Handshake**: Implements TLS handshakes that appear legitimate to network inspection while encapsulating the real traffic
- **Domain Fronting**: Masks traffic by routing through trusted CDN providers
- **HTTP/3 Masquerading**: Disguises traffic as standard HTTP/3 web traffic
- **Traffic Obfuscation**: XOR-based packet transformation to defeat pattern recognition
- **Spin Bit Randomization**: Prevents network analysis through QUIC protocol fingerprinting

### üîí Military-Grade Encryption
- **AEGIS-128L/X**: Authenticated encryption with hardware acceleration
- **MORUS-1280-128**: Lightweight cipher for resource-constrained environments
- **Perfect Forward Secrecy**: Ephemeral key exchange for maximum security
- **Post-Quantum Ready**: Designed to resist quantum computing attacks

### ‚ö° Performance Optimizations
- **SIMD Acceleration**: ARM NEON and x86 AVX2/AVX-512 optimizations
- **Zero-Copy Architecture**: Minimizes memory allocations for maximum throughput
- **Adaptive FEC**: TETRYS-based Forward Error Correction with dynamic redundancy
- **Connection Multiplexing**: Multiple streams over a single connection
- **0-RTT Handshake**: Reduced latency for subsequent connections

### üîÑ Adaptive Error Correction
- **TETRYS FEC Implementation**: Advanced coding scheme for lossy networks
- **Dynamic Redundancy**: Automatically adjusts to network conditions
- **Packet Recovery**: Up to 30% packet loss tolerance
- **Bandwidth-Efficient**: Minimal overhead compared to traditional FEC

## üèóÔ∏è Project Status

This project is currently being refactored from C++ to Rust to leverage modern language features and safety guarantees. The core functionality is being preserved while improving performance and security.

### Current Implementation (C++)
- QUIC protocol stack
- Basic VPN functionality
- Core encryption modules
- Initial stealth features

### In Progress (Rust)
- Complete protocol rewrite
- Enhanced security features
- Performance optimizations
- Expanded platform support

## üîß Build Instructions

This repository uses a Git submodule to include a patched QUIC library.
After cloning the project, initialize the submodule with:

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive libs/quiche-patched
```

If the command fails with a missing commit error, the upstream
`quiche` repository might not contain the pinned revision
`5700a7c74927d2c4912ac95e904c6ad3642b6868`. In that case, update the
submodule URL to a mirror that includes this commit and retry:

```bash
git submodule set-url libs/quiche-patched <mirror-url>
git submodule update --init libs/quiche-patched
```

### Building quiche

Compile the patched **quiche** library using Cargo:

```bash
cd libs/quiche-patched
cargo build --release
cd ../..
```

### Building with CMake

Generate the project and build all binaries:

```bash
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .
```

### Running the tests

After building, execute the unit tests with CTest:

```bash
cd build
ctest --output-on-failure
```

## üñ•Ô∏è Command-Line Usage

The project provides several binaries once built:

- **quicfuscate_demo** ‚Äì feature-rich demo tool with many options.
- **quicfuscate_client** ‚Äì minimal client accepting `<host> <port>` arguments.
- **quicfuscate_server** ‚Äì placeholder server without arguments.

Run `quicfuscate_demo --help` to see all available options. Important flags include:

```
  -s, --server <host>        Server hostname (default: example.com)
  -p, --port <port>          Server port (default: 443)
  -f, --fingerprint <name>   Browser fingerprint (chrome, firefox, safari, ...)
      --no-utls              Disable uTLS and use regular TLS
      --verify-peer          Enable certificate validation
      --ca-file <path>       CA file for peer verification
  -v, --verbose              Verbose logging
      --debug-tls            Show TLS debug information
      --list-fingerprints    List available browser fingerprints
```

## üîÑ Continuous Integration

The repository includes a GitHub Actions workflow that builds the project and
runs the tests on every push or pull request. You can find the workflow in
`.github/workflows/ci.yml`. To reproduce the CI steps locally run:

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
cd libs/quiche-patched && cargo build --release && cd ../..
mkdir -p build && cd build
cmake .. && cmake --build .
ctest --output-on-failure
```
