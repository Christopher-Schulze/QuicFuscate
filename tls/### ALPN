### ALPN
QUIC requires the use of ALPN (Application-Layer Protocol Negotiation). This is
normally optional in OpenSSL but is mandatory for QUIC connections. Therefore
a QUIC client must call one of `SSL_CTX_set_alpn_protos` or
`SSL_set_alpn_protos` prior to initiating the handshake. If the ALPN data has
not been set then the `QUIC_TLS` object immediately fails.

### Other Implementation Details
The `SSL_CONNECTION` used for the TLS handshake is held alongside the QUIC
related data in the `SSL` object. Public API functions that are only relevant to
TLS will modify this internal `SSL_CONNECTION` as appropriate. This enables the
end application to configure the TLS connection parameters as it sees fit (e.g.
setting ciphersuites, providing client certificates, etc). However there are
certain settings that may be optional in a normal TLS connection but are
mandatory for QUIC. Where possible these settings will be automatically
configured just before the handshake starts.

One of these settings is the minimum TLS protocol version. QUIC requires that
TLSv1.3 is used as a minimum. Therefore the `QUIC_TLS` object automatically
calls `SSL_set_min_proto_version()` and specifies `TLS1_3_VERSION` as the
minimum version.

Secondly, QUIC enforces that the TLS "middlebox" mode must not be used. For
normal TLS this is "on" by default. Therefore the `QUIC_TLS` object will
automatically clear the `SSL_OP_ENABLE_MIDDLEBOX_COMPAT` option if it is set.
